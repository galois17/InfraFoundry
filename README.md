# InfraFoundry 

A Production-Grade Docker & Kubernetes Stack Foundry

InfraFoundry is a curated collection of real, working, production-style infrastructure stacks built with Docker and Kubernetes.

This repository exists because writing manifests from scratch is painful — and most examples online are either incomplete, toy-level, or don’t actually run.
